	Lorem ipsum" text is derived from sections 1.10.33 of Cicero's De finibus bonorum et malorum.[1] It is not known exactly when the text obtained its current 		standard form; it may have been as late as the 1960s. Dr. Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar who was the publications director at Hampdenâ€“Sydney College in 		Virginia, discovered the source of the passage sometime before 1982 while searching for instances of the Latin word "consectetur" ("that [he/she/it] pursue", 		subjunctive), rarely used in classical literature.[2][a] The physical source of the lorem ipsum text may be the 1914 Loeb Classical Library Edition of the De 		Finibus, where the Latin text, presented on the left-hand (even) pages, breaks off on page 34 with </p>

	Lorem ipsum passages have been used by printers as dummy texts since the 1500s.[citation needed] It was popularized on Letraset dry-transfer sheets from the 		early 1970s, which were produced to be used by graphic designers for filler text.[4][2] Aldus Corporation created a version in the mid-1980s for their desktop 		publishing program Adobe PageMaker.[2] A variety of software today can generate[6] semi-random text which looks like jumbled Latin. Apple's Pages and Keynote 		software employs such jumbled text as sample screenplay layout. Lorem ipsum is also featured on Joomla!, Google Docs, and WordPress web content managers. 		Microsoft Word has a lorem ipsum feature.[7] Several LaTeX packages produce Lorem-ipsum-style text.[8][9]

			<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever 				since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five 				centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of 				Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of 				Lorem Ipsum.

			<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of 				using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it 				look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a 				search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by 			accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
